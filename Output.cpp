//Welcome To C++: Output
//Output is when the program "prints" data to the console "screen".
//Example 1:

//Header File Library
#include <iostream>

//Function
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "I am writing code!" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "You can do this infinetly" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
//If you ran this program the computer would print:
//Hello World!
//I am writing code!
//You can do this infinetly

//Example 2:
//Header File Library
#include <iostream>

//Main Function
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World! \n";
  std::cout << "Hello World! \n\n";
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
//If you ran Example 2, the computer would print:
//Hello World! 
//Hello World! 
//
//Hello World!
//Hello World!
// \n creates is like hitting enter on the keyboard when you are writting.
// \n\n create a line break
// endl does the same as \n
