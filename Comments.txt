Comments in C++
Comments are lines of text which are ignored by the compiler and are used to explain the code or to make the code easier to understand for humans. In C++, comments are either single line or multi-line.

Single Line Comments
A single line comment starts with double forward slashes "//". Anything that follows the slashes is considered a comment and is ignored by the compiler. For example:

// This is a single line comment 
Multi-Line Comments

Multi-line comments start with a forward slash and asterisk "/" and end with an asterisk and forward slash "/". Anything between the symbols is considered a comment and is ignored by the compiler. For example:

/* This is a 
multi-line 
comment */

Comments are very useful in helping other developers to understand the code. It is a good practice to write comments for all the functions, classes, and variables that you create in your code.
