//Written by: Artemis Solomon
//Welcome to C++: Output

//For this exercise you will be writing the entire program.
//Use the same steps from "Hello World!" module.
//Answers will obviously vary but should be written in the same structure

//Exercise 1:
//Write a program that outputs your name and your favorite color.
//Use the operator endl to create a new line.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "My name is Artemis!" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "My favorite color is Orange.";
  return 0;
}


//Exercise 2:
//Write a program that outputs a paragraph.
//use endl to format the paragraph into 4 lines.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello, my name is Artemis." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "I am learning how to write programs in C++!" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "I have learned how to write my very first program already!" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "I wonder what I will get to learn next?";
  return 0;
}

//Exercise 3:
//Write a variation of "Hello World!" Practice the different ways to perform outputs.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout "Hello" "World" "!";
  return 0;
}
